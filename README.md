# futuristic_projects

The future is made by us and not in hands of fate or something called as luck. We live in a holographic world and quantum world that have multiple worlds, and every action creates a new timeline and paradigms in this new world. There are many possible combinations and these can be leveraged for the benefits of the humans and use technology as a leverage to uplift human values, better automation and safer living. For all these to happen we need visionaries and engineers who can design and develop newer and better versions of the engineered products and present that to the society for overall growth, progress and better living and with no scarcity of food, water, clothing, free education and free money for self developments and learning that can improve personal value, and raise the levels and maturity of human interactions without biases, corruption and disputes. This is possible when there is abundance and this is possible by leveraging technologies and ideas 

We have various ideas in areas of:  Futuristic cities, living, traveling, studying, economy, defense, food, clothing, water, healthcare, money, social security, healthcare, life sciences, factories, climate, agriculture, corruption, project work, assets and resource management etc. These can be part of the ministerial portfolio 

Mere technology cannot provide the real value to the human society, there is a need of responsible philosophers, engineers, researchers, innovators, scientists who can help in catalyzing the ideas into real world assets. We provide various capabilities in limited quantity and manpower; however these are very significant and will help in realizing the project successfully.
